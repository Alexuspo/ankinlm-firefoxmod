# **AnkiNLM**

### *The fastest way to export NotebookLM flashcards into Anki.*


## **Overview**

**AnkiNLM** is a lightweight browser extension that adds **“Copy CSV”** and **“Download CSV”** buttons to the bottom of the NotebookLM Studio flashcard panel.
With a single click, you get a fully formatted CSV ready for import into Anki — no rewriting, no manual cleanup.

---

## **Features**

* One-click CSV export
* Copy or download support
* Compatible with Anki field mapping
* Optimized for math-heavy flashcards
* Preserves LaTeX syntax (`\sin(x)`, `\frac{a}{b}`, etc.)
* Lightweight and privacy-friendly

---

## **v1.2 Changelog**

* **Improved LaTeX compatibility** — CSV formatting now preserves LaTeX expressions for correct rendering in Anki.
* **Better handling of math-dense cards** — Formulas and equations display accurately after import.
* **Cleaner CSV output** — Small refinements for consistency and readability.

---

## **Recommended Setup**

To render mathematical expressions in Anki, use an add-on capable of interpreting LaTeX or MathJax.

**Recommended:**
**Better Markdown Anki** — Add-on ID **2100166052**

This add-on has shown the most consistent rendering results with CSVs generated by AnkiNLM.

> Note: AnkiNLM is not affiliated with or responsible for external add-ons. Any LaTeX-compatible template or renderer will work.
